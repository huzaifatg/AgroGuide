            <h2>Associated Diseases</h2>
            <div class="disease-section">
                <!-- Disease 1 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Anthracnose</h3>
                    <p>Anthracnose is a fungal disease that affects the leaves, twigs, and fruit of Custard Apple, causing dark, sunken lesions. It spreads in warm, humid conditions.</p>

                <!-- Disease 2 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Leaf Spot</h3>
                    <p>Leaf Spot causes small, dark spots on the leaves, which may eventually lead to yellowing and premature leaf drop. It can be controlled by removing infected leaves and using fungicides.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="leaf-spot.jpg" alt="Leaf Spot Disease" />

                <!-- Disease 3 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Black Sooty Mold</h3>
                    <p>This fungal disease grows on the sugary secretions left by aphids or scale insects, covering the leaves in a black, sooty substance. It can hinder photosynthesis and weaken the plant.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Root Rot</h3>
                    <p>Root Rot is caused by overwatering or poorly drained soils, leading to the decay of the tree's roots. It stunts growth and may kill the tree if not managed properly.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Custard Apple Wilt</h3>
                    <p>Custard Apple Wilt is a soil-borne disease that causes the sudden wilting and death of the tree. It is challenging to control and can result in the complete loss of crops.</p>

                    <h3>Fruit Rot</h3>
                    <p>Fruit Rot affects ripening Custard Apples, causing the fruit to soften, rot, and develop a foul odor. It is often caused by fungi and can be controlled by proper sanitation and fungicide applications.</p>
