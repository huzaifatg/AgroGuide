            <h1>Okra</h1>
            <p>Okra, also known as ladies' fingers, is a popular vegetable grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It's known for its edible green seed pods and is a rich source of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Warm and tropical climates are ideal for okra cultivation, with plenty of sunlight and moderate rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Fertile, well-drained soils with organic matter support optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Okra is typically sown in the summer and requires temperatures above 20Â°C for proper germination.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The plant grows to a height of about 2 meters and bears elongated green seed pods.</li>
            </ul>

                <!-- Disease 1 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus</h3>
                    <p>Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus causes yellowing of the veins in okra leaves, leading to reduced growth and yield. The virus is transmitted by whiteflies and thrives in warm climates.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="yellow-vein-mosaic-virus.jpg" alt="Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus Disease" />

                <!-- Disease 2 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>
                    <p>This fungal disease appears as white, powdery patches on leaves and stems. It reduces photosynthesis and can lead to defoliation and lower yields if left untreated.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="powdery-mildew.jpg" alt="Powdery Mildew Disease" />

                <!-- Disease 3 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Fusarium Wilt</h3>
                    <p>Fusarium Wilt causes the wilting and yellowing of okra leaves, starting at the base of the plant. It is a soil-borne fungus that can persist for several years in the soil.</p>

                <!-- Disease 4 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Cercospora Leaf Spot</h3>
                    <p>Cercospora Leaf Spot leads to the formation of small, circular, brown spots on leaves. The disease can reduce photosynthesis, leading to poor growth and yield.</p>

                <!-- Disease 5 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Root Knot Nematode</h3>
                    <p>Root Knot Nematode causes swelling and knotting of okra roots, leading to reduced water and nutrient uptake, wilting, and stunted growth.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Enation Leaf Curl Virus</h3>
                    <p>This virus causes curling and distortion of okra leaves, leading to stunted plant growth and reduced yields. It is spread by whiteflies and affects plant vigor.</p>
