            <h1>Potatoes</h1>
            <p>Potatoes are one of the most important staple crops globally, providing nutrition and sustenance to millions of people. Known for their versatility in cooking, potatoes are a major source of carbohydrates.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Potatoes thrive in cool, temperate climates with well-distributed rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained, sandy loam soils rich in organic matter are ideal for potato cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Potatoes are grown from seed tubers, which are planted in rows and require hilling to promote tuber development.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The crop needs consistent watering and protection from pests and diseases to ensure good yields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Diseases</h2>
            <div class="disease-section">
                <!-- Disease 1 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Late Blight</h3>
                    <p>Late Blight is a fungal disease that affects both the foliage and tubers of potatoes. It can rapidly destroy crops in wet conditions and is a major threat to potato production.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Potato Cyst Nematode</h3>
                    <p>The Potato Cyst Nematode is a soil-dwelling pest that attacks the roots of potato plants, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield. It can persist in soil for many years.</p>

                <!-- Disease 3 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Black Scurf</h3>
                    <p>Black Scurf is caused by a fungus that forms black, crust-like growths on the tubers. It can also affect young seedlings, leading to stunted growth and reduced vigor.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Powdery Scab</h3>
                    <p>Powdery Scab affects the skin of the potato tubers, causing raised, pitted lesions. The disease can spread through infected seed tubers and contaminated soil.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Potato Leaf Roll Virus</h3>
                    <p>Potato Leaf Roll Virus is spread by aphids and causes the leaves to roll upward, reducing the plant's vigor and yield. It can be controlled by using virus-free seed tubers and managing insect vectors.</p>

                    <h3>Soft Rot</h3>
                    <p>Soft Rot is a bacterial disease that causes the tubers to decay, often resulting in a foul-smelling, watery rot. It is favored by warm, wet conditions and poor storage practices.</p>
