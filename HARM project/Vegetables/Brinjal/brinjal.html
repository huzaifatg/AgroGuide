            <h1>Brinjal</h1>
            <p>Brinjal, also known as eggplant, is a widely grown vegetable, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. It is rich in vitamins and minerals and has been cultivated for thousands of years for its edible fruit.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Brinjal grows well in warm climates, requiring temperatures between 20°C and 30°C for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Loamy, well-drained soils rich in organic matter are ideal for Brinjal cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Brinjal is typically grown from seeds, and seedlings are transplanted when they are about 6-8 weeks old.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The plant bears purple, white, or green fruits, depending on the variety, and requires consistent care to yield healthy crops.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Diseases</h2>
            <div class="disease-section">
                <!-- Disease 1 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Leaf Spot</h3>
                    <p>Leaf Spot is caused by fungi and leads to the development of small, circular brown spots on the leaves. Severe infections can cause defoliation and reduced crop yield.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="leaf-spot.jpg" alt="Leaf Spot Disease" />

                <!-- Disease 2 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Bacterial Wilt</h3>
                    <p>Bacterial Wilt is caused by soil-borne bacteria, leading to wilting and death of the plant. Infected plants exhibit sudden wilting without yellowing of the leaves.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="bacterial-wilt.jpg" alt="Bacterial Wilt Disease" />

                </div>

                <!-- Disease 3 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Damping Off</h3>
                    <p>Damping Off affects Brinjal seedlings, causing them to collapse and die. This disease is caused by soil-borne fungi and thrives in wet, humid conditions.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="damping-off.jpg" alt="Damping Off Disease" />

                </div>

                <!-- Disease 4 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Little Leaf Disease</h3>
                    <p>Little Leaf Disease is caused by phytoplasma and results in the stunting of leaves, causing them to be small and deformed. Infected plants produce little to no fruit.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="little-leaf-disease.jpg" alt="Little Leaf Disease" />

                <!-- Disease 5 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Verticillium Wilt</h3>
                    <p>Verticillium Wilt is a fungal disease that causes yellowing and wilting of the leaves, starting from the lower branches. It can survive in soil for many years, affecting future crops.</p>

                <!-- Disease 6 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Mosaic Virus</h3>
                    <p>Mosaic Virus causes mottled patterns of yellow and green on leaves, reducing the plant's vigor and yield. The virus is transmitted by insects such as aphids and can persist in the plant tissue.</p>
