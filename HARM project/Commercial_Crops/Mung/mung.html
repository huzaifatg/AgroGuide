            <h1>Mung</h1>
            <p>Mung beans, also known as green gram, are a popular legume cultivated mainly in Asia. They are used in various culinary dishes and are known for their high protein content, making them a staple in vegetarian diets.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Mung grows best in warm, tropical climates with moderate rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained loamy soils with good fertility are ideal for mung cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Mung is typically planted during the monsoon season for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Mung beans are fast-growing plants, with short, bushy stems producing small pods filled with seeds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Diseases</h2>
            <div class="disease-section">
                <!-- Disease 1 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Yellow Mosaic Virus</h3>
                    <p>The Yellow Mosaic Virus causes yellow patches on leaves, leading to stunted growth and yield loss. It is transmitted by whiteflies and is one of the most severe diseases in mung beans.</p>

                <!-- Disease 2 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>
                    <p>This fungal disease appears as white, powdery spots on the leaves, stems, and pods. It affects plant vigor and can lead to early defoliation, reducing yields significantly.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="powdery-mildew.jpg" alt="Powdery Mildew Disease" />

                <!-- Disease 3 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Cercospora Leaf Spot</h3>
                    <p>Cercospora Leaf Spot causes small, dark spots on leaves, which gradually increase in size. It can lead to leaf drop and severely affect the plant's photosynthesis process.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Anthracnose</h3>
                    <p>A fungal disease causing sunken, dark lesions on stems and pods, leading to reduced pod formation and yield loss. Anthracnose can spread quickly in wet and humid conditions.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Root Rot</h3>
                    <p>Root rot affects the roots of mung plants, causing the roots to decay, leading to stunted growth and yellowing of leaves. It is caused by waterlogged soil and poor drainage.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Rust</h3>
                    <p>Rust is a fungal disease that causes reddish-brown pustules on the leaves, leading to premature defoliation. Severe infections reduce plant vigor and yield.</p>
