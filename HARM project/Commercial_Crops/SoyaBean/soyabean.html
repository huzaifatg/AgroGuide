            <h1>Soyabean</h1>
            <p>Soyabean is one of the most important oilseed crops worldwide. It is a major source of protein and oil and is widely cultivated for its nutritional value and use in various industries.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Soyabean grows well in warm, temperate climates with sufficient rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained, fertile soils with a neutral pH are ideal for soyabean cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Soyabean is usually sown in spring, and it requires full sun for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The plant grows upright with bushy branches and produces pods containing seeds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Diseases</h2>

                <!-- Disease 1 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Soyabean Rust</h3>
                    <p>Soyabean Rust is a fungal disease that forms reddish-brown pustules on leaves, causing premature leaf drop and reduced yield. It is spread by wind and is prevalent in warm, humid conditions.</p>

                <!-- Disease 2 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Frogeye Leaf Spot</h3>
                    <p>This disease causes circular, grayish-brown spots on the leaves, which may expand and form large lesions. It can affect the quality of the seeds and reduce yield.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">

                <!-- Disease 3 -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Sclerotinia Stem Rot</h3>
                    <p>Sclerotinia Stem Rot, or white mold, appears as white, cottony growth on stems and pods. It leads to wilting and premature plant death, severely affecting yield in cool, moist conditions.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Phytophthora Root Rot</h3>
                    <p>Phytophthora Root Rot affects the roots, causing wilting and yellowing of leaves. It thrives in waterlogged soil and can cause significant yield loss in susceptible varieties.</p>

                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Sudden Death Syndrome</h3>
                    <p>This disease leads to rapid wilting and yellowing of leaves, followed by premature leaf drop. It often occurs alongside root rot and can severely reduce crop yield.</p>

                    <h3>Brown Spot</h3>
                    <p>Brown Spot appears as small, brown lesions on leaves, which can merge into larger patches. It typically occurs in wet, humid conditions and affects the photosynthetic ability of the plant.</p>
